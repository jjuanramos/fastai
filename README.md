In this repo I will be documenting all of the insights I obtain from the course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).

As I am interested in building data products, I believe that I should know modern stuff such as Deep Learning. I think I know my stuff about ML, but I have never really dove into DL, and I think it's about time.

On the same note, I will be attending *although online* the [Full Stack Deep Learning course](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/), which is mostly focused on deploying, monitoring and testing Deep Learning algorithms, so I better understand what they are useful for before it starts.

So let's see what's all the hype about!
