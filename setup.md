### Set up

I am setting up the course in [Gradient](https://console.paperspace.com) in order not to run the notebooks locally. I will be taking advantage of its free tier version, so I will be using its Free-GPU Nvidia Quadro M4000. First thing I notice is how much it reminds me of Google Colab. Why? because it's slooooooow. It's free though, so I can't really  complain.
